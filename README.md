# 🐦 Flappy Bird Game (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

A fully functional **Flappy Bird clone** developed using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The game runs in the browser using the **HTML5 Canvas API**, featuring smooth animations, responsive controls, collision detection, and a clean UI.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a recreation of the popular **Flappy Bird** arcade game.  
The player controls a bird and must navigate through gaps between randomly generated pipes. Each successful pass increases the score. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

The project focuses on:
- Game physics
- Canvas rendering
- JavaScript animation loops
- Clean UI/UX design
